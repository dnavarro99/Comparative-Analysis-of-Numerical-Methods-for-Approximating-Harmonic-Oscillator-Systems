# Comparative-Analysis-of-Numerical-Methods-for-Approximating-Harmonic-Oscillator-Systems
# The harmonic oscillator problem is a fundamental concept in physics and engineering, playing a crucial role in various fields such as mechanical engineering, electrical circuits, and quantum mechanics. Understanding the behavior of harmonic oscillators is essential for predicting and analyzing the dynamics of many real-world systems. In this project, I aim to investigate and compare the accuracy of two numerical methods, Euler's method and the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) method, in approximating the solutions of the harmonic oscillator system.
